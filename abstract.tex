The Ethereum platform is a public, distributed, programmable blockchain-based
database where users can submit transactions by invoking smart contract
functions.
%
Verifying smart contracts is extremely important considering bugs might cause
money losses to interested parties, and that these contracts are immutable
after deployment.
%
Unfortunately, proving safety for assertions in a function often entails
considering contract invariants, i.e. facts only emerging from the overall
behaviour of many contract functions.
%
%
In this work we present a technique for modelling Solidity smart contract as
Constrained Horn Clauses, using IC3 to automatically learn contract
invariants necessary to prove assertions safety.

Recent approaches for verifying smart contracts 
use existing symbolic verification techniques
specific for other domains like e.g. C, Java etc.
Although reusing and adapting existing techniques is 
appealing, several domain specific features can make
domain translation challenging or unsound.
We propose a direct encoding for smart contracts 
using constrained horn clauses,
that allows the synthesis of 
contract invariants i.e. facts only emerging from the overall
behaviour of many contract functions.
