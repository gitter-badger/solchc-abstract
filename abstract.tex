	The Ethereum platform is a public, distributed, blockchain-based database where users submit transactions by invoking contract functions.
%
Verifying contracts code is extremely important considering bugs might cause money losses to interested parties, and  the sources become immutable after deployment.
%
Unfortunately, proving safety for assertions in a function often entails considering contract invariants, i.e. facts only emerging from the overall behaviour of many contract functions.
%
Manually providing contract invariants is an error prone approach because automatic verification would assume them regardless their validity.
%
In this work we present a technique for modelling a contract based on Constrained Horn Clauses, using IC3 to automatically learn contract invariants necessary to prove assertions safety.
