\begin{abstract}
The Ethereum platform is a public, distributed, programmable blockchain-based
database where users can submit transactions by invoking smart contract
functions.
%
Verifying smart contracts is extremely important considering bugs might cause
money lossies to interested parties, and that these contracts are immutable
after deployment.
%
Unfortunately, proving safety for assertions in a function often entails
considering contract invariants, i.e. facts only emerging from the overall
behaviour of many contract functions.
%
Manually providing contract invariants is an error prone approach because
automatic verification would assume them regardless their validity.
%
In this work we present a technique for modelling Solidity smart contract as
Constrained Horn Clauses, using IC3 to automatically learn contract
invariants necessary to prove assertions safety.
